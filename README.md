# Numerical Solutions of Differential Equations in C++

This repository contains C++ code implementations for solving various types of differential equations using numerical methods. The focus is on practical approaches to approximate solutions for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) commonly encountered in scientific computing.

## Features

- **Methods Implemented:**
  - Euler's Method
  - Runge-Kutta Methods (2nd, 4th Order)
  - Finite Difference Method (for PDEs)
  - Other numerical techniques (e.g., Adam-Bashforth, Backward Differentiation, etc.)
  
- **Types of Equations:**
  - Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
  - Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
  - Boundary Value Problems
  - Initial Value Problems

- **Flexible for extension**: The code is designed to be easily extended to solve other types of differential equations
